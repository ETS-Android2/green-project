# Green & Fresh

During this project, we are going to develop an IoT application, the main idea behind this is to meassure some physical variables and converting that data into a dashboard.

This project is about meassuring fruits, we are taking the color and weight to decide if the fruit it's in good shape, in case it is not, we rejected. We will build this project as an Industry 4.0, where the automatization of data and accurracy are really important.
